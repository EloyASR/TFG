## Description
The objective of this Final Degree Project is to develop a web application that allows for the centralized administration of tournaments for different eSports games, providing a system for reporting matches and tournaments as well as player performance.

To achieve this goal, the application will include three user profiles. First, the administrator, responsible for the comprehensive management of the tournaments, including the creation, configuration, sponsorship administration, and distribution of prizes. Second, the players, who are the tournament participants, should be able to manage their registration in the tournaments and view their performance statistics on their personal profile. Finally, companies, which will have the ability to manage the prizes and sponsorships associated with the tournaments.

The tournaments will consist of various phases or stages, each composed of different series or sets of matches. These phases will be structured in two formats. First, the League phase, where participants will compete against each other in a round-robin system, accumulating points based on the results obtained. Second, the Elimination phase, where contestants will compete in direct matches, with the loser of each match being eliminated from the tournament.
